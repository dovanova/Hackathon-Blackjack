# Welcome to Blackjack

In this game you will be able to enter a specified amount of money to gamble with, and as long as you keep that total above zero, 
you can continue to play. You can enter a new bet amount after each hand.  



## Rules



1. This casino follows traditional blackjack rules. "Stay" and "Hit Me" are used to either keep your current cards, or to ask for another. 
If your card total goes above 21, you "Bust" and lose the game to the house. 



2. Absolutely no cheating will be tolerated. This includes card counting, looking at the source code as you play, opening up the console, or by any other means. 



3. Have fun!! (And hopefully make some money.)
